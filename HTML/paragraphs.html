<!--The best way to type paragraphs in HTML is by using the pre tag.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <title> 
        PRE TAG
    </title>
    <body>
        <pre>
We are inside a pre tag inside which the webpage displays whatever I write here 
<!--The hr tag is used to insert a horizontal line-->
<hr>
See, I jumped to a new line without the br tag
<hr>
AGAIN!
<hr>
I am also giving           multiple spaces without any of them being truncated
        </pre>
    </body>
</html>
