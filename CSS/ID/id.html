<!-- We can create IDs in html to identify an element.
For example, we may have multiple h1 elements but if we can to uniquely identify each one of them,
We can create an ID just as done while creating radio buttons in forms -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <h1 id="sample"> This is a Heading</h1>
    </body>

    <!-- We can use IDs multiple times -->
    <body>
        <h1 id="sample"> This is another heading</h1>
    </body>
</html>
